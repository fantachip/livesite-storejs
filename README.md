STOREJS
=======

StoreJS is the online store plugin written for LiveSite. It supports inline editing just like LiveSite itself and is extremely easy to use. New products are created by simply navigating to an unused url, picking the template for the page and then entering the appropriate data inside the editable boxes right on the page. 

StoreJS currently supports payments with PayPal, Payson and Klarna.
